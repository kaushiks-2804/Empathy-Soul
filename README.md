# 🌿 Empathy Soul: An AI-Driven Mental Health Support Interface  

## 📖 Overview  
**Empathy Soul** is an AI-powered conversational mental health support system designed to provide **empathetic, context-aware, and accessible digital mental health assistance**.  
It integrates **Hybrid Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **3D animated avatars** to deliver ***engaging, emotionally supportive, and interactive conversations***.  

The system leverages **retrieval-based + generative NLP models**, **sentiment analysis**, and **emotional UI design** to help individuals practice **positive mental health** and ***emotional self-care***.

## ✨ Features  

- 🧠 **Hybrid LLM** (*Generative + Retrieval-based*) for **accurate and empathetic responses**.  
- 💬 **Context-Aware Conversations** with **memory** and **dialog tracking**.  
- 🎭 **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis** to detect user mood (*stress, sadness, calm, etc.*).  
- 🎨 **Interactive 3D Animated Avatars** for **immersive engagement**.  
- 🔒 **Safe & Ethical Design** with **content moderation** and **mental health guidelines**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

The system combines:  
- **User Input → NLP Pipeline → Sentiment Detection → Hybrid LLM Response → Content Moderation → Output**  

**Core Modules:**  
1. **Data Collection & Annotation** – Mental health datasets annotated with *sentiment & emotional states*.  
2. **Hybrid LLM** – Combines a `GPT-based generative model` with **retrieval-based responses**.  
3. **Chatbot using SNN** – Ensures **coherent conversational flow**.  
4. **Frontend (React + 3D Animations)** – Built with **React** and styled for **emotional design**.  
5. **Backend (Flask/Python)** – Handles API, WebSockets, and **sentiment detection**.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, `3D Animations`  
- **Backend:** `Python (Flask)`, `WebSockets`  
- **AI/NLP Models:** Hybrid **LLM (Transformer + Retrieval)**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Sequential Neural Networks (SNN)**  
- **Database:** `Vector Database` for **context retrieval**  
- **Other Tools:** `Grad-CAM` (Explainability), **Preprocessing Pipelines**  

---

## 📊 Results  

- ✅ Improved **response relevance** and **user satisfaction**.  
- ✅ Increased **empathy, emotional engagement, and trust**.  
- ✅ Created a **safe, stigma-free, and supportive digital environment**.
